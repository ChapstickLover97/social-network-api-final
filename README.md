  ## Description 

  This is the backend to a hypothetical social-network API that deals with users, their friends, the thoughts they are able to share with each other, as well as their reactions to each others thought, all utilizing a Mongoose and Express.js.  This is comparable to a lower-functioning version of early-Twitter, and can be used as a template for creating generic social network interactivity.

  ## Dependencies  

  Express.js, Mongoose

  ## Usage 

  If you decide to download the code for yourself, you will use Insomnia or any other HTTP-based API tester.  Upon running "npm run start", you will see Terminal display ("live at 3001), and you must specify "3001" as the port you're using for testing.  You will also have to create your own routes in the tester, but you can follow along in the video as I demonstrate the routes I used, as well as the payload (if required).
